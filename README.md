<h1>Hi, I'm Samuel! <br/><a href="https://github.com/sfal3mer/Cloud-HoneyNet-SOC">Cybersecurity Professional</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-falmer/">IT Specialist</a> </a></h1>


<h2> ðŸ¤³ Welcome to my GitHub repository! :</h2>
This is where I showcase my adventures in cybersecurity. You'll find a variety of projects that demonstrate my ability to build secure environments, manage security incidents, and improve security postures. One of my favorite projects is the construction of a mini honeynet within Azure - it was a thrilling 48-hour rollercoaster ride of measuring and improving security metrics.

But that's not all! This repository also includes my contributions to open-source projects, my own experimental projects, and a collection of resources that I've found incredibly useful in my cybersecurity journey.

Feel free to explore, and don't be shy to reach out if you have any questions or if you're interested in collaborating on a project. I'm always excited to meet new people in the field! You can also connect with me on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-falmer/) or drop me an email at samuelfalmer3@hotmail.com. Let's secure the digital world together!
